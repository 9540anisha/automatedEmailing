Introduction

We created a simplistic website that has a form where users can input their skills (probably through a pdf resume) and also input a pdf of a professor's research that they are interested in. Our program would extract key information from both and draft an email to the professor asking them to let the user work for them.
It can be incredibly tedious to have to email professors and research all of their past work, so our program will make it easier and faster.

Background

As students that want to step into research but donâ€™t want to pay for camps that cost thousands of dollars, we want to get a similar experience with professors or PhD students working in fields of interest. However, with competition growing and many of these professors receiving hundreds of emails a day, we as students need to email more and more professors, and in an effort to connect professors with the best-fit interns for their project while ensuring that students are fully interested, we will limit the number of generated summarizations and key points available, and other automated emails sent will be generic.
